    *used VSCode Copilot autofill to generate, then checked over and edited as necessary 
    edits included removing the primary key and using the autoincrementing built-in,
    making sure that the string has all of the neccessary information, substituted out 
    .CheckConstraint method for unique_together in Like model, added .ManyToManyField
    methods for N-to-M relationship mappings & went over all models afterwards to 
    ensure consistency
